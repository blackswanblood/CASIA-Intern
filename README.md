Daily-Process and self-reflections
- Dive into Deep learning and Reinforcement learning and hopefully gain some meaningful insights.
- The course I took along with is [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). It is a superb intro course for Deep learning and computer vision.
- This is the course about [RL](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) by [David Silver](https://www.davidsilver.uk/) at UCL. He has led several renowned, cutting edge projects including AlphaGo, AlphaStar and AlphaFold.
